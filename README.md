Ashlie Lynn Chandler - Code 201 - First Guessing Game - November 9, 2015

This is my first guessing game. 

I built it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The script itself uses a multi-dimensional array to loop through a series of 
questions, correct answers, wrong messages and correct messages, and if/else if/else statements tell the computer to log, push, 
print and alert something depending on whether the question was answered correctly or not.

I used the MDN website as a reference and read through several StackOverflow conversations about multi-dimensional arrays.

Now for a joke. I apologize ahead of time if you are religious or get offended easily.

What do a Christmas tree and a priest have in common? 
Their balls are just for decoration.
